    ##Best practices
    
    https://anansewaa.com/javascript-shorthand-coding-techniques/
    
    https://www.techbeamers.com/javascript-tips-best-coding-practices/
    
    Study: 
    
      Write declarative code
      Functions with a purpose
      Manage scope
      Reduce state changes
      Don't reassign
      Don't mutate
      Preventing Objects from mutating
      Preventing Arrays from mutating
      Write pure functions

    Example questions: 
    
      Why do you avoid global variables?
      Why use strict equality (===) instead of normal equality (==)?
      How do you use ternary operators to help you write terser code?
      What ES6 features help you write terser code?

 # NOT STARTED - Basic React and Responsive Design
 
	 ## React++ 
 
 		   ------------------------ Lets build something cool and have AHA moments. ------------------------

		   This section is dedicated to break out of the PURE Javascript Loop for a little bit to get back to the real world, here we will take the newly found learned and applied knowledge into a small project for a potentional employer, this also combats fatigue (learning fatigue in the JS area) and rewires the brain to create associations across the board when it comes to REACT  and Javascript as an ecosystem. 

		   "Creating a comfort zone is great, its meaning youre learning, stepping out is even better".

		   "The whole point here is to create AHA moments."

    Front-End Web Development with React


         This course explores Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library (Currently Ver. 16.3). This course will use JavaScript ES6 for developing React application. You will also get an introduction to the use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design. You will be introduced to various aspects of React components. You will learn about React router and its use in developing single-page applications. You will also learn about designing controlled forms. You will be introduced to the Flux architecture and Redux. You will explore various aspects of Redux and use it to develop React-Redux powered applications. You will then learn to use Fetch for client-server communication and the use of REST API on the server side. A quick tour through React animation support and testing rounds off the course. You must have preferably completed the previous course in the specialization on Bootstrap 4, or have a working knowledge of Bootstrap 4 to be able to navigate this course. Also a good working knowledge of JavaScript, especially ES 5 is strongly recommended. At the end of this course you will: - Be familiar with client-side Javascript application development and the React library - Be able to implement single page applications in React - Be able to use various React features including components and forms - Be able to implement a functional front-end web application using React - Be able to use Reactstrap for designing responsive React applications - Be able to use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application

    Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native

    This course focuses on developing truly cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps using React Native (Ver 0.55) and the Expo SDK (Ver. 27.0.0). React Native uses modern JavaScript to get truly native UI and performance while sharing skills and code with the web. You will learn about UI development with React Native UI and layout support and access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript using the Expo SDK. You should have already completed the Bootstrap 4 and the React courses in this specialization before proceeding with this course. At the end of this course you will be able to (a) Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase, (b) Leverage your React and Javascript skills, (c) Use various features of React Native and the Expo SDK to build truly cross-platform mobile applications, and (d) Use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application
    
    
### Course3 -done

      https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs

        Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB

        This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. We examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API. We touch upon authentication and security. Finally we review backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services. At the end of this course, you will be able to: - Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST - Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework - Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services
